# Personal Website

This repository contains a simple personal website built with React using CDN scripts. The design draws inspiration from Apple's minimalist aesthetic.

## Local Development

Open `src/index.html` in your browser. The page loads React from a CDN so no build step is required.

If you make changes to the JavaScript or CSS files, just refresh the page to see the updates.

## Directory Structure

```
src/
  index.html  - entry point loading React and your app
  style.css   - styling inspired by Apple design
  app.js      - React components defining site sections
```

## Deploying to Google Cloud

You can deploy this static site using **Google Cloud Storage**.

1. **Create a bucket** in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the "Static website hosting" option.
2. Upload the contents of the `src` directory (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`) to the bucket.
3. Set the bucket's permissions to allow public access to `index.html`.
4. Note the bucket's public URL and share it as your website link.

For more advanced hosting (e.g., using a custom domain or HTTPS), see the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website).

### Continuous deployment from Git

If you want changes pushed to this repository to automatically update your Google Cloud Storage bucket, set up a **Cloud Build** trigger:

1. Push this repository to GitHub or Google Cloud Source Repositories.
2. In the Google Cloud console, open **Cloud Build** â†’ **Triggers** and create a trigger bound to the `main` branch.
3. Add a `cloudbuild.yaml` file to this repo containing:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - -c
      - |
          gsutil rsync -r src gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
```

Every push to `main` will run this build and sync the `src` folder to your bucket.

To use your domain `bogibee.com`, map it to the bucket following the [custom domain guide](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#custom-domains) and update your DNS records.

## Personalization

Replace the placeholder text in `app.js` with information from your resume. Each `Section` component corresponds to a section of your website: education, employment, and other interests.
